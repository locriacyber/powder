# Powder

A roguelike with tile-based graphics available for **many platforms**. You can get it at http://www.zincland.com/powder/index.php.

While the game has UI suitable for GBA and NDS, it is not suitable for computers with big monitors. By forking this project, I intent to make this game more accessible and more extensible (custom fonts and tiles), and easier to contribute to.

Well, I can only guarantee Linux support with my additions.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Build without dependencies (except the Zig compiler)
- [ ] Rearrange UI and display shortcut near menu items
- [ ] Load custom fonts and tilesets and add menu to choose between them; also add documentation
